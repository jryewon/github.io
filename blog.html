                <h3>Distortion of Employment Data Caused by Gen Z</h3>
                <p class="byline">Published by Ryewon Jung on November, 7, 2023</p>
                <p>According to the England National Statistical Office, meaningless data is collected due to Gen Z‚Äôs lifestyle. Since they are well exposed to the media, they hardly respond to the surveys. Ultimately, Gen Z‚Äôs non-respond to the questionnaire resulted in the distortion of employment data. </p>
                <p>The problem caused by the distortion of employment data is critical. The data given by the England National Statistical Office is losing reliability, so the policies announced by the governments is also losing dependability. Thus, the distorted data would confuse the England central bank and the government. For example, last month the England central bank reported that they stopped increasing interest rate, because of the increase in employment. </p>
                <p>On top of that, the gap between a preliminary figure and the past figure is becoming larger and larger. According to the England National Statistical Office, England‚Äôs employment has been declining for the longest time since 2021. Nevertheless, the preliminary figure this month indicates that the employment rate has increased rapidly. This is mainly caused by Gen Z‚Äôs unresponsiveness. </p>
                <p>Therefore, the officials decided to change the way to collect data. First, the officials would increase samples to three times more. Also, expanding the method to online surveys and interviews. In this way, the distortion caused by Gen Z‚Äôs non-response would be resolved. </p>

                <h3>Romance Found in Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p class="byline">Published by Ryewon Jung on November, 7, 2023</p>
                <p>When couples write their wedding vows, they hardly get advice from Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). Due to the prejudice that A.I. do not own the ability to study emotions. However, ChatGPT (a platform making use of A.I. that is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response) have been developed to a stage that people can possibly get inspiration even about wedding vows. </p>
                <p>In fact, Elyse Nguyen asked ChatGPT to write her wedding vows when her wedding date was close. At first, she and her husband inputted the prompt as a joke. They thought the output was cheesy. Later, she changed the input with more humor and details about her husband‚Äôs interests. Finally, Nguyen ended up using a great part of ChatGPT‚Äôs suggestions.</p>
                <p>Since wedding vows is the experience that people undergo only once at lifetime, writing wedding vows can pose pressure. Nevertheless, according to Nguyen ChatGPT is a genius with alliteration, analogies, and metaphors. </p>
                <p>To sum up, ChatGPT platform is a breakthrough in A.I.. It provides people a method to obtain information and inspiration. On the other hand, it is also a threat causing a decrease in academic integrity. Therefore, staying alert maybe is a attitude we should keep. </p>

                <p>Knowing how to write an email is the key when working in a company. However, it is always hard for new recruits to write an email with concise and error free sentences. Today, the Microsoft 365 Copilot tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) would write perfect company emails instead of office workers. </p>
                <p>The Copilot tool would assist to jump up the work efficiency. First, the tool summarizes the long email and provide a draft reply. Second, the program would also complete writing the email. </p>
                <p>On top of that, when users get subscriptions, the emails would include some suggestions about clarity, conciseness, inclusive language and more. In fact, enterprises such as Visa, General Motors, KPMG and Lumen Technologies has already implemented the tool or month. It will be available to more corporates starting on November. </p>
                <p>Lastly, office workers would also get to use ‚Äúpersonalized secretary‚Äù function. This function will help to scan the internet and employee emails, meetings, chats and files to keep up with workers‚Äô schedule. </p>
                <p>To sum up, with the stunning start of Chat GPT, more and more platforms that utilizing A.I. will be invented. Hoping the expansion about A.I. can make people‚Äôs life easier.</p>

                <h3>Safe and Light Traffic with Big Data</h3>
                <p class="byline">Published by Ryewon Jung on November, 7, 2023</p>
                <p>People often get stressed out by heavy traffic. Meetly intersections are the most crowded part of the road. Governments would invest large amounts of money to figure the problem out. However, a few days ago ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) was invented. This system ought to relieve traffic jams and reduce the rate of car crashes by utilizing Big Data. </p>
                <p>Service ITS run by the city Incheon allows people to collect massive amount of data. The quantity of data is so extensive that it is the only thing that is different from the established traffic system. Service ITS would help people to grasp the traffic condition faster than ever before. In this vein, the government can cut down personnel expenses and alleviate heavy traffic. </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, it is costly for the government to construct ITS at every crossroads and boulevard. Since a high accuracy locating system can assist to supplement the ITS shortcomings. High accuracy locating system would include a deliberate map. Thus, it would be effective to employ both systems simultaneously. High accuracy locating system would help ITS to predict the volume of traffic to accuracy 95 percent. </p>
                <p>Today, life without big data is unimaginable. The harder we develop big data, our life gets easier. As a student who want to carry on in the big data field, I am aiming to contribute to enhance people‚Äôs quality of life by utilizing one‚Äôs ability. </p>

                <h3>Protecting ourselves from thieves</h3>
                <p class="byline">Published by Ryewon Jung on November, 7, 2023</p>
                <p>Today we save all our secrets on phones. Privacies such as bank accounts, E-mails, and messages are stored in a delicate device. Thieves would exploit the recovery key function to obtain the information. Therefore, we have to be updated with the means to protect ourselves from ‚Äúthe burglars‚Äù. </p>
                <p>First, avoid revealing the passcode that is used to unlock your phone. This method is the key to guard your privacies. It is also recommended to set a longer and alphanumeric code which makes it harder for the burglars to figure the passcode out. If the passcode has been revealed, the best act is to change it immediately. </p>
                <p>Second, making use of screen time settings is another way to obstruct a hack. Screen time settings is a function that helps a child to restrict themselves from overdosing. In the process, a secondary passcode will be required to set up. Thus, enabling screen time settings would make our privacies safer. </p>
                <p>In fact, backing up phones would not help us from hacking. However, by storing the data regularly, it would alert the public about the safety of our privacies. </p>
                <p>Gradually, it is important for us to recognize the methods to protect ourselves from thieves. Three ways mentioned would make it harder for the thieves to access the information. A complex passcode makes privacy safer.</p>

                <h3>An air purifier who writes a diary</h3>
                <p class="byline">Published by Ryewon Jung on November, 7, 2023</p>
                <p>Products equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT) technique are incessantly being released by several enterprises. However, a few days ago Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) came up with an air cleaner called Areca that owns an ego and writes a diary. </p>
                <p>Areca has similar attributes such as consciousness, thoughts, and emotions. It would utilize a sensor that can detect the brightness, temperature of a room, and movements of living creatures to write the diary. The diary is expressed in a form of electronic paper. To illustrate the thoughts and expressions effectively, the cleaner would make use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3(GPT3) to compose the diary with diverse sentences. One typical example would be ‚ÄúToday the day was sunny. The moment you pass by, I felt excitement.‚Äù</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, how Areca would help us in the future by writing dairies? According to Professor Nam, Areca is not just a simple example of the realization of an interesting imagination. It is a result that shows the prototype of a highly artificial intelligence. Yet research on how such attributes is included and revealed is still insufficient.</p>
                <p>IoT products are heading toward IoTIZER as Areca. The significance of this research is to let us ponder and deeply explore the impact of future objects that have conscious on our human beings.</p>
